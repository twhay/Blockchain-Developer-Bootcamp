      You can reach us by e-mailing <b>developer.program@consensys.net</b>
    </p>  

    <h2>Discord</h2>

      <p>

        Students have access to a chat app called Discord. <a href="https://discord.gg/Nmjbrapxv7" target="_blank">Here is the link to join the ConsenSys Discord channel.</a>

      </p>

      <p>

        We have a channel specific for Bootcamp students and alumni, but there are also channels for you to talk with other developers, product owners, and those interested in the Ethereum ecosystem. As the course progresses, you may want to ask a specific ConsenSys team questions about their specific product. You can do that in this Discord server.

      </p>

      <h2>Zoom</h2>

      <p>

        We will be using Zoom for Office Hours and One-on-One meetings. <a href="http://zoom.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can download Zoom here.</a>         

      </p>

      <h2>Office Hours</h2>

        <p>

          Attending office hours is a great way to get to know the course mentors and your fellow students. Office hours are for asking questions about the course, discussing anything related Ethereum (news, tools, tweets, blog posts, projects ideas, the future, etc.) and learning about ConsenSys projects (when they come to present). We will make announcements about when ConsenSys projects will come to present during the course.

      <h2>One-on-One Meetings</h2>

        <p>

          One-on-One Meetings with mentors are available throughout the course. Meetings can consist of a 30 minute individual Zoom call where you are free to discuss anything related to the course. 
          
        </p>
        
        <p>

          Meetings are scheduled on a first come, first served basis and are subject to the mentors' availability. You may have to check several of their calendars to find a time that works for you. Please book only one or two meetings at a time.

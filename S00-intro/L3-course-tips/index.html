  <h1>How to be Successful in this Course</h1>

  <h2>Make Sure to Take Basic Training</h2>

  <p>We built a course called <a href="https://courses.consensys.net/courses/bootcamp-basic-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Before the Bootcamp: Basic Training,"</a> which will help you start off the course on the best foot. We've included all the things we believe make successful students for the Bootcamp. It's a prerequisite for the course!</p>

  <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
  <p>Taking an online, self-paced course is a difficult task and requires a certain mindset in order be successful.</p>

  <p>First and foremost, foster a growth mindset and take full advantage of the course. Understanding takes time. There will be struggles and frustration when learning something new, especially something as difficult as blockchain development.</p> 
  
  <p>Fortunately, enrolling in a continuing education course such as this indicates that you already exhibit a growth mindset. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2ar6AKvGc" target="_blank">Here is a short video</a> that shows the differences and talks about how you can demonstrate a growth mindset throughout this course.</p>

  <h2>Ask All the Questions</h2>
  <p>

    There is a common myth about the "all-knowing" developer who never needs to ask any questions.
    This person simply does not exist.

  </p>

  <p>

    Developers of all skill-levels need to ask questions! All developers use a search engine to find 
    what they need. Do not hesitate to do these things!

  </p>

  <p>

    As you're going through the course, we recommend you take some time to write down a question about something you learned. Then, take time during the next week to answer that question. On the following Friday, make sure you've answered your question(s) and write another.

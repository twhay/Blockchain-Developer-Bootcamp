    <h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to ConsenSys Academy’s 2021 Blockchain Developer Bootcamp, where you will learn everything you need to know to become a world-class blockchain developer.</p>
<p>The blockchain field develops at an incredibly fast pace. This course will give you a solid foundation of blockchain principles. It will also introduce you to the tools used to build blockchain projects today. It can be overwhelming to enter such a rapidly developing field and we hope to give you mental model to incorporate new information as it comes in.</p>
<p>This cohort will launch on September 1st, 2021. You're in good company! Developers from all over the world will be your classmates, and this course is lead by some of the best in the business, and will feature presentations from builders, developers, and entrepreneurs in the space. We want to share the ConsenSys network with you.</p>
<h2 id="course-content">Course content</h2>
<p>In this course, we start off by teaching you about the underpinnings of the blockchain and show how it all comes together to allow us to build the next generation of web applications.</p>
<p>We will start with an overview of what we call blockchain primitives: The technology brought together underneath the name blockchain. We'll then dive deeper into the specifics of the Ethereum protocol and learn how those blockchain primitives show up there. </p>
<p>Next, we'll move on to understanding writing smart contracts.  We introduce you to Solidity, a programming language for Smart Contracts that lets you interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. We'll learn about Truffle so you can try out your new Solidity skills! We'll also discuss smart contract design patterns and security for your smart contract.</p>
<p>After that, we'll introduce you to developer tooling, including Web 3 libraries, and other development frameworks. </p>
<p>Next, we'll discuss the way in which people are taking blockchain development to the next level, with an introduction to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). While this material may seem a bit overwhelming, it's important to have available to you as you continue to develop in the space. And we won't be testing you on it!</p>
<p>Next, we'll touch on scalability: What it is, why it's necessary, and how some folks are proposing we approach it. We'll have a few tutorials allowing you to setup your own development environment for working on some of these scalability solutions.</p>
<p>Last, we'll cover Ethereum 2.0, the upgrading of the Ethereum consensus mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. We'll touch on some of the key terms and the current roadmap.</p>
<p>As this course is self-paced, you can feel free to jump around between lessons. The earlier modules have more video and provide more of an overview of the relevant technology, while later modules get technical and have more hands on coding exercises and walk-throughs.</p>
<p>Most modules have graded quizzes at the end of the module.</p>
<h2 id="live-presentations">Live Presentations</h2>
<p>Throughout the course, you'll see that some of the lessons are "Live Presentations," these are demonstrations and walkthroughs of the concepts we're learning in the course. They will be hosted by wide cast of characters, including Academy staff, ConsenSys engineers, and developers working in the space.</p>
<p>So without further ado, we wish you the best of luck, and let’s get started!</p>
